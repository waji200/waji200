        "content": "We helped Abou Arab Haider — a 135-year-old sweets brand — bring their legacy online with a modern, custom-built B2C e-commerce platform. The goal was to reflect their long-standing Damascene heritage while offering a seamless online store experience in both Arabic and English. Using a tailored stack and animation-heavy design, we delivered a performance-optimized and culturally rich digital storefront.",
        "challenge": "The client needed a clean, minimal, and elegant UI that could showcase their century-old story in both Arabic and English. We were tasked with implementing a scroll-based animated line that tracks user progress through the site — requiring an SVG path to be designed in Figma and animated in code. Managing bi-directional layout support for Arabic (RTL) and English (LTR), along with integrating a lesser-known backend (MedusaJS), posed unique development challenges.",
        "solution": "We designed the entire website in Figma, building a highly polished and minimal UI. On the frontend, we used Next.js with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and the shadcn/ui library to ensure rapid development. Supabase was used for form submissions, and we implemented a custom internationalization setup with next-intl. The backend was powered by MedusaJS, integrated with plugins for e-commerce functionality. Hosting was handled through Dockerized deployment on Coolify, ensuring smooth CI/CD workflows. Custom scroll-line animation was implemented by converting SVG paths from Figma and dynamically controlling stroke progress with JS.",
        "results": "The client was extremely pleased with the final result and praised the visual storytelling and smooth bilingual experience. The website successfully showcases their heritage while functioning as a full-fledged e-commerce platform. Performance benchmarks were met, and the custom animations helped differentiate their digital presence in a highly competitive industry."

The goal was to break away from traditional storefronts and let the website become an expressive visual medium.

From an animated logo reveal to an infinite cloth surface with interactive scroll-based camera transitions, this site redefined how users experience product discovery.",
        "challenge": "The biggest challenges were technical — writing raw GLSL shaders for the cloth distortion, camera transitions, and color dispersion effects. Making all the animations performant, responsive, and cross-device-compatible while retaining high fidelity was demanding. Coordinating the 3D interactions with traditional UI components added another layer of complexity.",
        "solution": "Using React Three Fiber and React Three Drei, I built a 3D canvas-driven website with dynamic scene transitions. I animated the EveryRep logo using custom GLSL shaders, simulating it breaking into pieces and reforming in 3D. After the intro, the user is immersed into an infinite, scroll-reactive cloth surface with pin-pointed interactive labels. The split-screen shader slider enables toggling between men’s and women’s product categories by dragging across the screen. Scroll direction manipulates camera zoom, and final transitions trigger dispersion and blur effects to emphasize immersion.",
        "results": "Despite the complexity, the result was a uniquely immersive brand experience that elevated EveryRep’s digital identity. The client was thrilled with how the interactivity aligned with their bold branding. Site engagement metrics showed higher user retention and scroll depth compared to their previous design."
